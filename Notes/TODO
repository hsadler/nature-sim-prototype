REFACTOR GAME TO 3D:
    X make new scene and repurpose 3d version scripts
    X convert environment tile prefab
        - give height
        - convert to non-sprite
    X convert scene management scripts 
    - add start screen and transitions from 2d and 3d demos
    - convert player camera

V1:
    X test proceedural generation of environment tiles
    X create player character
    X create movable, zoomable camera
    X create environment tile state
    X test proceedural generation of environment with different tile states
    X create mouseover tile to show state
    X design tile visual changes to represent state:
        X decide what visuals represet each state or combination of states
        X decide what earth sprites to be used
        X decide what water sprites to be used
    X make water amount translate to earth type
    X make earth elevation translate to shadow overlay (darker=low, bright=high)
    X make water amount reflect water overlay transparency (deeper = lower transparency)
    X visually represet heat
    X build environment tile update system based on neighbors
    X build flow system for water
        X get basic water flow working
        X get water flow to take into account earth elevation
    X create global config for game settings
        X add initial values to config
        X keep adding to this central config
    - create terrain configurations for testing
        - single slope
        - valley
        - hole
        - hill
        - (possibly create terraforming tools)
    - build flow system for heat
    - only visually render sprites in camera view
    - build v1 environment generation algorithm

V2:
    - add day/night cycle

V3:
    - add water cycle (rain)

V4:
    - add erosion

V5:
    - add geo activity
