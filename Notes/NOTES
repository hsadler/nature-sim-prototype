Tile states:
    - earth type
    - elevation
    - heat
    - water

Dynamic natural forces:
    - day/night cycle:
        - light rays
        - heat
    - weather:
        - rain
        - heat
    - erosion:
        - alter elevation
    - geo activity:
        - alter elevation
        - change earth type


Open Questions:
    - do different earth/water types have different properties when interacting 
        with other systems? Ex. light reflection, heat transfer coefficient, 
        hardness (affect erosion), etc, etc.
